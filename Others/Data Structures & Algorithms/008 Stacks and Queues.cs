Stacks and Queues


Array and ArrayList are data structures that helped us group the data in a convenient form for processing,
but neigher of the two provides a real abstraction for actually designing and implementing problem solutions.

Two list-oriented data structures that provide easy-to-understand abstractions are stacks and queues.
Data in a stack are added and removed from only one end of the list, whereas data in a queue
are added at one end and removed from the other end of a list. 


#Stacks

We define it as a list of items that are accessible only from the end of the list, which is called
the top of the stack. The standard model for a stack is the stack of trays at a cafeteria. 
Trays are always removed from the stop, and when it is put back on by placing it on the top.
A stack is known as a Last-in, First-Out data structure.

The two primary operations are Push and Pop. You push to add an item to a stack, and pop to take an
item off the stack.



#Queues

A queue is a data structure where data enters at the rear of a list and is removed from the front
of the list. It is used to store items in the order in which they occur. It is an example of a 
first-in, first-out data structure. 

The operation for adding an ew item is called Enqueue, and the operation for removing an item
is called Dequeue. 












#Summary 
Learning to use data structures appropriately and efficiently is one of the skills that (separates
the expert programmer from the average programmer). The expert programmer recognises that (organizing
a program's data into an appropriate data structure) makes it easier to work with the data. In fact,
(thinking through a computer programming problem using data abstraction) makes it easier to come up with
a good solution to the problem in the first place.

Stacks are used for solving many different types of problems in computer programming, especially in
system's programming areas such as interpreters and compilers. Stacks are used to solve more generic 
problems, such as determining if a word is palindrome. 

Queues also have many applications. 
OSs use queues for ordering processes and queues are used quite often for simulating real world processes.
