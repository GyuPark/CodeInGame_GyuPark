Keywords

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/






use "out" keyword in two contexts :
1) as a parameter modifier, which lets you pass an argument to a method by reference rather than by value.
2) in generic type parameter declarations for interfaces and delegates, which specifies that a type parameter is covariant.


"ref" indicates a value that is passed by reference, and is used in four different contexts :
1)*in a method signature and in a method call, to pass an argument to a method by reference
2) in a method signature, to return a value to the caller by reference
3) in a member body, to indicate that a refernce return value is stored locally as a reference...
4) In a struct declaration to declare a ref struct or a readonly ref ...
